The source code for Dindel itself is released under GPL3.

In the directory you will find parts of the Boost library (www.boost.org), and
parts of the Seqan library (www.seqan.de). You will still need to install a copy
of the Boost library in order for the program_options to compile. The parts of
the Boost library included in Dindel are there to make it compatible with old
versions of Boost which didn't have 'foreach.hpp' for instance. The Seqan
library is included as Dindel uses its Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align
candidate haplotypes to the reference sequence.

You will need to download the source code for SAMtools in order to compile
Dindel. The path to the SAMtools source files can be specified in the Makefile.

If all libraries are in place, simply type "make" at the command line to compile
Dindel.
